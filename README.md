3. **Cart Page:** Allowing customers to review and modify their orders before placing them.
4. **Error Page:** Handling errors gracefully, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
5. **Order Placement Page:** Where customers can confirm and place their orders.
6. **Order Status Page:** Showing the order status after it has been placed.

This tech stack is selected to be on par with a modern and efficient setup for developing a React-based web application with Vite as the build tool. It includes tools for routing, styling, linting, type checking, and animation. The project seems well-equipped for building a dynamic and responsive web application.
